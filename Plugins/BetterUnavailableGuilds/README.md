Force Discord to show server icons of unavailable servers, instead of "1 server is unavailable" and enable interaction with the server (ability to leave the server, move it around, etc).

## Features
Whenever BetterDiscord, BetterDiscord2 and some other servers go unavailable, they are removed from your sidebar, even your folder, and shown as ! all the way at the bottom, which is annoying.  
This plugin simply fixes that, so the server stays in the sidebar and you can move it around/interact with it, you just can't view anything inside it.
BetterDiscord and BetterDiscord2 servers are precached for convenience sake.
