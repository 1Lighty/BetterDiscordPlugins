### 1.0.5
- Fixed settings not showing anything.
- Lowered the minimum WPM setting to be 50 instead of 300, for you slower readers. If the notifications go away too fast, just enable `Calculate timeout by number of words` and lower the `Words Per Minute` slider in settings.

- Fixed unparser erroring out and not calculating the timeout properly.

### 1.0.3
- Fixed notification sound not playing if Discord was focused.
- Large messages no longer go off screen.
- Added a timeout based on number of words, the WPM can be changed between **300** and **900**, or can be turned off entirely and let all notifications stay for 5 seconds.
- Added option to set the bar color to the authors top role color. Can be turned off.
- Added option of setting a custom bar color. If you want to change the background color of the notification, peek into XenoLib settings.
