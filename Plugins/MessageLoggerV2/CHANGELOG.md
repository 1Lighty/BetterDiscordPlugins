- Help button in settings
- Extensive help for all functions of the logger, both in the menu and settings. Some things are rather hidden.

### 1.5.0
- Added image caching. If a link of an image expires, you'll still have a local copy of the image. In its place will be a small thumbnail of the image and clicking on it will open it in your default image viewer. The reason it's like this is because it's a limitation of Discord and the only simple workaround will slow down a client to a halt.
- Added context menu options for entire message groups, accessible by rightclicking the timestamp
- Fixed image related context menu options not working too well when multiple images are sent in one message
- Delete + click now works on images
- Copy to clipboard/Save to folder should work more reliably due to image caching
