# [BetterImageViewer](https://1lighty.github.io/BetterDiscordStuff/?plugin=BetterImageViewer "BetterImageViewer") Changelog
### 1.2.3
- Fixed startup error.

### 1.2.2
- Fixed jpeg images having their EXIF rotation applied when you tried to zoom. (Thank you person that reported this issue on my server, you know who you are <3)

### 1.2.0
- Image previews will take up as much space as possible, larger images will be easier to view.
- Image pixel will always be the same size as a physical pixel, this means all images will look sharp no matter what scaling your Discord (and system) is set to. Unless the image has been downscaled.
- Added a way to load the images at full resolution instead of downscaled.  
**Pro tip**: don't fucking enable this, you *WILL NOT* notice a god damn difference. You can also force it to load the full res by *CTRL + CLICK*ing the preview. When it's loading the full res image, the first resolution at bottom right will turn red.

### 1.1.3
- Fixed not picking up embeds with multiple images
- Added workaround for a rare patching error

### 1.1.2
- Improved performance when smoothing is disabled

### 1.1.0 & 1.1.1
- *SOME* people kept asking, so here you go.
- Added image zoom, simply activate by click and holding on the image.
- Use scroll wheel to zoom in and out, hold shift while scrolling to change lens size.
- If you prefer using a different plugin to handle zooming for you, that's fine too, there is a toggle to disable it in settings.
- The click and hold can of course be easily changed in the settings to your prefered method of zooming.
